Action Transformer for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00606)


o The Transformer architecture has been one of the most important deep learning
advances of the last years in natural language processing


o Human Action Recognition have proposed the integration of attention mechanisms
with convolutional and recurrent blocks to improve the accuracy of models.


o Action Transformer applies a pure Transformer encoder derived architecture to action
recognition obtaining an accurate and low-latency model for real-time applications.
